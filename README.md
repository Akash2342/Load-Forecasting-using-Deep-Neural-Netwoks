# Load-Forecasting-using-Deep-Neural-Netwoks
Load forecasting is an essential part for the power system planning and operation. In this project, the focus is on Load Forecasting. The load forecasting is carried out for the power system of Panama. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) have been used for forecasting the loads which have the advantage of learning directly from the historical data. The CNN, LSTM and BI-LSTM here uses data such as past load, weather information like humidity and temperatures. Once the neural network is trained for the past set of data it can give a prediction of future load. This reduces the capital investment reducing the equipment to be installed.
